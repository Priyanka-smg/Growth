Problem Statement

Modern QA and DevOps teams often struggle with consistent environment setup, repeatable builds, and automated test execution. Manual steps lead to errors, delays, and lack of reliability in CI/CD pipelines.

--------------- Solution---------------------------------------------

This project provides a self-contained automation framework that:

Automates environment setup (Java, Maven validation)

Ensures reliable builds with Maven (clean → compile → test → package)

Integrates unit and smoke testing with reporting

Produces ready-to-deploy artifacts for CI/CD integration

Maintains a clean project structure for scalability (UI/API/DB testing)
